# QuackieShop

Stream processing project for Week 6 of the data engineering bootcamp with Makers

## Brief

"You just joined the company QuackieShop. They run an e-commerce website selling various items.

They would like to implement a robust stream processing infrastructure to process various events from different sources – such as the website and their mobile applications – to generate analytics insights and for additional purposes, such as detecting user patterns or fraud.

Your job will be to implement a Kafka cluster using Amazon MSK, and implement the different components needed to handle the events from the source systems, process them, and record them into destination data stores."
